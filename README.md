# React Static List of Posts (JS)

- prepared `posts` by adding a `user` and `comments` to each `post` (each comment has a `postId`);
- splitted the `App` into components based on given CSS blocks;
- styles from `App.scss` should be moved to separate files, as well. E.g.: `PostList.scss`;
- `List` components should take an array of corresponding objects and render one `Info` component per object;
- `Info` components should take one object and render its data.
